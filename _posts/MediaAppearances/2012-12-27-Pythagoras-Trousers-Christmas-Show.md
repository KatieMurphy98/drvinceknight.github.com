I had great fun on this christmas quiz on [Rhys Phillips's](https://twitter.com/Rhys_Phillips)' radio show.

I went up against [Ben Evans](https://twitter.com/@drbenevans) of Swansea University and managed to embarrass myself on multiple occasions.

You can listen to the whole thing [here](http://www.rhysphillips.co.uk/pythagoras-trousers/episode-103/).
