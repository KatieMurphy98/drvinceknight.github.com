Rhys Phillips asked me to give the Pythagoras lecture which was very kind. I chose to speak about the mathematical modelling we do here at Cardiff applied to healthcare.

You can listen to it [here](http://www.rhysphillips.co.uk/pythagoras-trousers/pythagoras-lecture-mathematics-healthcare-management/).
