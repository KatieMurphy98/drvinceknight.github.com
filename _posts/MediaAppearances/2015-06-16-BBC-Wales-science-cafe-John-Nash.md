Following the unfortunate death of John Nash, I joined [Peyton Young](http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Academic/h-peyton-young), [Faron Moller](http://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/people/homepage.php?staff=F.G.Moller) and [BBC Radio Wales' Science Cafe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00848zw)'s host [Adam Walton](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5c0n4GCb6cwYDnWw2rbcwn0/adam-walton) to
discuss the game theoretic concept of Nash Equilibria: [you should be able to
listen to it at this link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05xwdmx).
