[James Campbell](https://plus.google.com/+JamesCampbell95/posts) (a student here at Cardiff University) and I spent this Summer working on writing some Game Theoretic Code for [Sage](http://sagemath.org/).

We worked on 3 separate tickets:

- 16331: Matching games - I wrote a blog post about this [here](http://vincent-knight.com/unpeudemath/code/2014/08/27/sneak-preview-of-game-theory-in-sage-2-of-3/)
- 16332: Cooperative games - I wrote a blog post about this [here](http://vincent-knight.com/unpeudemath/code/2014/08/01/a-sneak-preview-of-game-theory-in-sage-1-of-3/)
- 16333: Normal form games - This was the biggest piece of work and is still awaiting review.

Ticket 16331 has been reviewed and merged in to the latest release of Sage.
As a result of this James and I are officially Sage contributors and you can see our 'names in lights' at the [developer map](http://sagemath.org/development-map.html).
Contributing to Sage is something I've personally wanted to do for a while so I'm very happy about this.
