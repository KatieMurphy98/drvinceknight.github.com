Professor [Tim Phillips](https://twitter.com/Phillips32Tim) (head of school of the School of Mathematics) has kindly agreed to sponsor 3 student tickets for [DjangoCon Europe 2015](http://2015.djangocon.eu/).

The 3 students have been picked (but not told) and the decision has been based on their submissions for their individual coursework in my Computing module.
You can view some of the submissions [here](http://vincent-knight.com/Computing_for_mathematics/Assessment/IndividualCoursework/PastCourseWorks/).
