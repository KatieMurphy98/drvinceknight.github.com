I am delighted to be finally allowed to announce that I've been awarded a
[Sustainable Software Institute
Fellowship](http://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/). You can see the
full list of fellows here:
[www.software.ac.uk/fellows/](http://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/)

I am going to be using the fellowship to hold two workshops:

1. On stochastic modelling;
2. On computational game theory.

More about that to come.
