Here's the abstract of the paper:

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are facing increasing pressures in many
nations given that demands on the service are rising. This article focuses in
particular on the operations of the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST), which
is the only organisation that provides urgent paramedical care services on a
day-to-day basis across the whole of Wales. In response to WASTâ€™s aspiration to
improve the quality of care it provides, this research investigates several
interrelated advanced statistical and operational research (OR) methods,
culminating in a suite of decision support tools to aid WAST with capacity
planning issues. The developed techniques are integrated in a master workforce
capacity planning tool that may be independently operated by WAST planners. By
means of incorporating methods that seek to simultaneously better predict
future demands, recommend minimum staffing requirements and generate low-cost
rosters, the tool ultimately provides planners with an analytical base to
effectively deploy resources. Whilst the tool is primarily developed for WAST,
the generic nature of the methods considered means they could equally be
applied to any service subject to demand that is of an urgent nature, cannot be
backlogged, is heavily time-dependent and highly variable.
