Here's the abstract of the paper:

Stroke is a medical emergency, and if patient outcomes are to be optimised
there should be no delays in accessing treatment. This project focuses on the
application of Operational Research methodology to investigate how the Royal
Gwent Hospital can comply with revised computerised tomography (CT) scanning
guidelines for stroke. Such guidelines, released by the Royal College of
Physicians recommend a 50% reduction in time from hospital admission to report
of a CT head scan to just 12 hours. The results of statistical analyses of
historical data were used to populate a discrete event simulation model of
patient flow through the CT scanning unit in SIMUL8. The model was then applied
to explore a number of operational modifications to the CT scanning system
through a series of scenario analyses. The results of this investigation
presented evidence of a number of strategies to support operational
improvements in relation to revised stroke guidelines.
