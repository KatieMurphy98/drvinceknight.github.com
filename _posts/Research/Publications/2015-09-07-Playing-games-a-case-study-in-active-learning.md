Here's the abstract of the paper:

This paper describes two active learning activities which aims to introduce
students to the game theoretic concepts of best response dynamics and repeated
game analysis.
An overview of some literature on active learning and the benefits therein is
provided. This highlights that activities such as the one described in this
manuscript, not only help engage students but more importantly improve their
learning and understanding.
The final section of this work describes how these activities fit in the
pedagogic framework of a particular undergraduate mathematics class. Students
generate data that can be used as context for the understanding of theoretic
concepts. It is suggested that this framework is not restricted to the subject
of game theory.
