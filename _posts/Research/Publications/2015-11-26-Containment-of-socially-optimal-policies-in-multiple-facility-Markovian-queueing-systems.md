Here's the abstract of the paper:

We consider a Markovian queueing system with N heterogeneous service facilities,
each of which has multiple servers available, linear holding costs, a fixed
value of service and a first-come-first-serve queue discipline. Customers
arriving in the system can be either rejected or sent to one of the N
facilities. Two different types of control policies are considered, which we
refer to as ‘selfishly optimal’ and ‘socially optimal’. We prove the equivalence
of two different Markov Decision Process formulations, and then show that
classical M/M/1 queue results from the early literature on behavioural queueing
theory can be generalized to multiple dimensions in an elegant way. In
particular, the state space of the continuous-time Markov process induced by a
socially optimal policy is contained within that of the selfishly optimal
policy. We also show that this result holds when customers are divided into an
arbitrary number of heterogeneous classes, provided that the service rates
remain non-discriminatory.
