This is a pre print of a paper introducing a piece of software that myself and
many others have written.

The abstract is:

The Axelrod library is an open source Python package that allows for
reproducible game theoretic research into the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. This
area of research began in the 1980s but suffers from a lack of documentation
and test code. The goal of the library is to provide such a resource, with
facilities for the design of new strategies and interactions between them, as
well as conducting tournaments and ecological simulations for populations of
strategies. With a growing collection of 122 strategies, the library is a also
a platform for an original tournament that, in itself, is of interest to the
game theoretic community. This paper describes the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma,
the Axelrod library and its development, and insights gained from some novel
research.

The paper is currently on the arXiv, you can read it here:
