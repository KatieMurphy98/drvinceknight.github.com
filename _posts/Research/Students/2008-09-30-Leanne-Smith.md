Leanne completed her Phd supervised by [Professor Harperl](http://www.profpaulharper.com/), [Dr Williams](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/contactsandpeople/profiles/williamsje.html) and myself. She modelled the Welsh ambulance service using location analysis and discrete event simulation.

[Here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048312000436) is one paper that we wrote during her Phd.
