Angelico is supervised by [Professor Harper](http://www.profpaulharper.com/), [Dr Williams](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/contactsandpeople/profiles/williamsje.html) and I.

His research looks at applying agent based models to 'real' social networks. He's looked in to cool things like link prediction to see how networks evolve over time.

[Here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437111009897) is a paper that we wrote during the first year of his PhD and here is a video of him winning a poster prize at [ORAHS 2012](http://www.utwente.nl/mb/orahs2012/):
