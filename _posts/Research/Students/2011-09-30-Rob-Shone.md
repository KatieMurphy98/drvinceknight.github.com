Rob (supervised by [Professor Harper](http://www.profpaulharper.com/) and I) is working on the optimal control of queueing systems, modelling situations where agents can choose between multiple queues. He is using Markov Decision Processes to do this, finding optimal policies through the using of dynamic programming techniques (at times: approximate dynamic programming techniques).

He has proved various nice theoretical results and also published [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221712009472) based on his undergraduate BSc. project.

Rob also developed a variety of teaching videos that you can see on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/raphile01).
