[Imogen](https://twitter.com/Imogen_Dunne) carried out a project entitled: 'The
Effect of Personality Traits on Academic Achievement in Flipped versus
Traditional Learning Environments'.  Imogen carried out a variety of statistical
analysis of performance and questionnaires which lead to some very interesting
results.  We are currently working on a manuscript based on this but you can
read a copy of her project
[here](/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/StudentProjects/ImogenDunneProject.pdf).

Here is a photo of [Imogen](https://twitter.com/Imogen_Dunne) and I at her
