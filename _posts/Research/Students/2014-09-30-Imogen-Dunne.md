Imogen carried out a project entitled: 'The Effect of Personality Traits on
Academic Achievement in Flipped versus Traditional Learning Environments'.
Imogen carried out a variety of statistical analysis of performance and
questionnaires which lead to some very interesting results.
We are currently working on a manuscript based on this but you can read a copy
