[James](https://plus.google.com/+JamesCampbell95/) built some of the original Game Theoretic capability in to [Sage](http://sagemath.org/) during the Summer of 2014.
He will continue to work on Sage starting by implementing a test for degeneracy
of games.

This project is funded by the [School of
Mathematics](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/).
