The Prisoner's dilemma is a very simple game that has been used to
explain the basic of game theory since the middle of the last century.
In the 1980s Professor Axelrod created a computer tournament inviting
participants to write strategies for a repeated version of this simple
game. The findings of this and subsequent tournaments have been used
to understand how certain types of behaviour (in particularly
cooperative behaviour) can emerge in a variety of environments.

This project will concentrate on the basics of this tournament and in
particular on a paper from 2012 that showed a particular type of
strategy could do well. From a theoretical point of view a good grasp
of basic probability and linear algebra is required.

The project will involve the use of an open [source library written in
Python](http://axelrod-python.github.io/) and if things go well will hopefully
also contribute code to be used by others.

The student will be expected to learn Python (a programming language)
as well as version control (a modern software development tool).
