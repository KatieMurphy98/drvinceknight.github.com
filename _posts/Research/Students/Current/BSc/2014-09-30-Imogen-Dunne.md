Various modern pedagogic techniques make use of technology to better scaffold student learning. One such pedagogy is referred to as a ‘flipped classroom’. This approach aims to modify the locus of knowledge exchange so that learners are able to obtain knowledge outside of contact time with the educator. The goal of this is to make  use of contact time for a deeper learning experience.

A new module in the School of Mathematics (MA1003) has been designed and delivered using a flipped classroom methodology.

The goal of this project will be to understand students’ learning through this module. An understanding of learning models as well as modern trends in pedagogic approaches will be considered. Further to this quantitative and qualitative methods of evaluation of learning will be used through the design and delivery of student questionnaires as well as interviews.

This project is well suited to a student interested in pedagogic theory and statistical analysis and design of questionnaires.
