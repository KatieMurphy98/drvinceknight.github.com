Matthieu is a student from Clermont-Ferrand (France) and will be working with me for 3 months. The idea is to look at the potential for Game Theory being applied to surgery scheduling.

Here's the project description I put together a while back:

The Scheduling of surgeries is a very difficult task, of concern to all hospital managers. In general a schedule can be thought of as a matching between surgeries and schedule slots. It is conceivable that every surgeon would have preferences with regards to which slot their surgeries are given. This could be based on personal preference as well as patient outcomes. Similarly it is conceivable that the hospital has a preference of matchings between surgeons and/or surgery slots. This leads to the scheduling of surgeries to be considered as a matching game.

The purpose of this project is to evaluate considering surgery schedules in this light. An understanding of game theoretic methodologies will be considered, in particular focusing on the Gale-Shapley algorithm and variations thereof. Furthermore, applications of these methodologies will be evaluated. This will initially concentrate on small scheduling instances before being applied on real scheduling data sets.
