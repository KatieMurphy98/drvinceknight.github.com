Julie was supervised by [Professor Harperl](http://www.profpaulharper.com/) [Dr Gillard](http://www.jonathangillard.co.uk/) and myself. Her PhD applied time dependent queueing models to the Welsh Ambulance service.

[Here](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jors/journal/v63/n11/full/jors2011160a.html) is a paper that we wrote during her PhD.

She is currently a joint postdoc with the School of Mathematics and [ABCi](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/866/page/69733).
