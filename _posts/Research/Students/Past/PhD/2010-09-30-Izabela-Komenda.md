Izabela did her PhD with [Professor Griffiths](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/contactsandpeople/profiles/griffiths.html) and myself applying queueing theory to bed management in a critical care unit.

[Here](http://imaman.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/2/137) is one paper that we wrote during her PhD.
She is currently a joint postdoc with the School of Mathematics and [ABCi](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/866/page/69733).
