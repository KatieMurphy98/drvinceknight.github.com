Iain built a simulation model that allowed for the simulation of individuals choosing between various healthcare service centres. This lead to a publication in [Jos](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jos/journal/v6/n2/full/jos201121a.html).

Iain's project was funded by a [CUROP](http://learning.cf.ac.uk/curop/) award.
