In this project Jason built an Agent Based Simulation to consider game theoretical behaviour in a series of two queues. Here is a video of a talk he gave at [OR54](http://www.theorsociety.com/Pages/Conferences/OR54/OR54.aspx):

He blogged about his internship (that was funded by a [LANCS](http://www.lancs-initiative.ac.uk/) grant) [here](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/guest-post-summer-research-internship.html).
