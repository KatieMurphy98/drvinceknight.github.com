    <p>My teaching philosophy is still developing but revolves around a student centred learning approach scaffolded through the use of technology. For more information about my teaching please take a look at my <a href="./PCUTL">PCUTL</a> page.</p>

    <p><a href="./fairmarks">Here</a> is a page containing some resources for assigning fair individual marks in group projects using game theory,</p>

    <p>Here is a full list of the courses I have taught, will teach and/or am currently teaching:</p>

    <p>
    <ul>
    {% for course in site.data.courses %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{course.url}}">
          {{ course.title }}
        </a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>If you are interested in possibly doing a research project with me (I am always eager to work with hard working students) then take a look at my <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/research'>research</a> pages</p>
